# Numerical Method or Numerical Analysis
Numerical methods are a collection of techniques used to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved exactly.

## Hey There!

This is my full course on Numerical Methods exclusively on YouTube with notes.

Whether you’re a student, a professional, or just someone passionate about mathematics and computational techniques, this course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of numerical methods. I will cover a wide range of topics including

🔹 Error Analysis
🔹 Root Finding Algorithms
🔹 Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation
🔹 Numerical Integration and Differentiation
🔹 Solving Linear Systems
🔹 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
🔹 Ordinary Differential Equations
🔹 And much more!

This course will be structured to help you grasp both the theory and practical application of numerical methods, with plenty of examples, exercises, and real-world problem-solving techniques.

Stay tuned and let’s make learning fun and engaging!
